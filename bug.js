The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase that can occur when using transactions with multiple concurrent updates.  The issue arises when multiple clients attempt to update the same document's field simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results due to the way Firebase's transactions handle concurrency.

```javascript
firebase.firestore().runTransaction(async transaction => {
  const docRef = transaction.get(firebase.firestore().collection('counters').doc('myCounter'));
  const oldCount = (await docRef).data().count;
  transaction.update(docRef, {
    count: oldCount + 1
  });
  return transaction;
});
```

This code attempts to increment a counter field. While seemingly simple, with many concurrent requests, the transaction could fail if the oldCount is read and then immediately another client updates the document, causing race conditions and incorrect incrementations.
